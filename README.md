# House Hunters - HGTV

"House Hunters" is a television show in which families are shown several homes and then choose one to purchase. Each episode is set in a specific city.

Since its debut in 1999, the show has aired over 3,200 episodes. However, there is no official database that specifies the locations featured in each episode. 

**The episode descriptions do not explicitly state their locations. Here GPT is used to find out he locations**

Utilizing the database created in this notebook, users can now locate episodes specific to a certain city. This is particularly useful for people considering relocating, as it provides them with actual video tours of neighborhoods, offering a glimpse into the housing market of the city.

The actual episodes are not available here, but they can be accessed on various streaming platforms.
